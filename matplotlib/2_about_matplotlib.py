"""
this library is used to display data graphically
it can create 2D,3D graphs
we can give that form any where to be graphically represented.

through we can create multiple types of graphes their names are given as :

1: linear plot  => it gives a linear graph. it shows a line which represent the data 
                   of x axis and y axis.
                   we can create sin wave, cos wave plot in this.
                   also we can create this plot from any given random data.

2: scatter plot  => in this plot the graph is shown as a dotted graph
                   all the values like high value low value are shown by dots.

3: bar plot  => in this we create a graph like a rectangle from bottom to upward
               
4: stem plot  => it graph the data when the data is given of some specific point.
5: step plot  => ye steps ki tarah hota hai like k hm stairs(seeriyoun) prr chartay hain
5: hist plot  => 
6: box plot  => 
7: pie plot
8: fill_between plot => ye tab use hota hai k for example humein maaloom karna hai k jo high value hai
                        and jo low value hai uss k beech mein kitna area fillup huaa hai 
                        uss ko maloom krnay k liye hm fill_between ko use krtay hain...



every plot has its own properties.
